# Cloud CMS SDK

Welcome to the Cloud CMS SDK GitHub Repository.

This repository contains all of the sample code, examples, demos and getting started code for Cloud CMS.  Rather than
maintain numerous separate repositories, we've elected to collect all of this stuff in a single place so that everything
is available in place and easy to find.

In general, the process for building and working with examples will differ based on the technology.  For example,
building an Android app is considerably different than building a Node.js module or Titanium app.  Check the README
file in each directory for further guidance.

In terms of getting started, please visit:

    https://www.cloudcms.com/sdk.html

This page provides an entry point in terms of what you need to know as a developer of Cloud CMS.  It covers API Keys,
connecting and more.

Enjoy! Changed
